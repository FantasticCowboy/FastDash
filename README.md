# FastDash

FastDash enables users to do the following

- Read delta encoded depth frames from disk
- Reassemble those delta encodings into full depth frame data
- Convert that frame data into a point cloud
- Stitch those point clouds together to form a volumetric video
- Run a pose estimation algorithm on the stitched together point clouds
